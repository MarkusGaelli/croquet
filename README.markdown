A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/MarkusGaelli/pen/XWJevXW](https://codepen.io/MarkusGaelli/pen/XWJevXW).

Croquet is a synchronization system for multiuser digital experiences. 

Creating a Croquet application does not require the programmer to write separate client and server code. Applications are developed as though they are local, single-user experiences, and Croquet takes care of the rest.
